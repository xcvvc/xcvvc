- 👋 Hi, I’m Lance @xcvvc
- 👀 I’m interested in various small algorhythms that are first statistical and later intelligence related.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning cgi scripting in order grab data from big number sources, such as finance and weather, then way later to gather from utf-8 sources outside Latin.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on parallel math processing, especially to address a problem of calculating 1,000,000 covariances
- 📫 How to reach me? at x@xcvvc.com (the bottom row of the keyboard)
